This repo contains solutions to the following Google Challenge Labs:
	■ Create and Manage Cloud Resources
	■ Perform Foundational Infrastructure Tasks in Google Cloud
	■ Set Up and Configure a Cloud Environment in Google Cloud
	■ Automating Infrastructure on Google Cloud with Terraform

Just some Terraform scripts to support these articles.

Terraform : All Articles

Note: 
While most tasks can be completed using Cloud Console, I have preferred gcloud CLI and Terraform.
